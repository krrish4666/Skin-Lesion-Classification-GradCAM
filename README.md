# Skin Cancer Classification with Deep Learning

A deep learning approach to classify skin lesions using the HAM10000 dataset, addressing extreme class imbalance through advanced techniques including focal loss, aggressive class weighting, and data balancing strategies.

## üéØ Problem Description

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide, with early detection being crucial for successful treatment. However, accurate classification of skin lesions presents several challenges:

- **Class Imbalance**: Real-world medical datasets suffer from severe class imbalance (58:1 ratio in HAM10000)
- **Visual Similarity**: Different skin conditions can appear visually similar
- **Medical Expertise**: Requires dermatological expertise for accurate diagnosis
- **Scalability**: Need for automated screening tools to assist healthcare professionals

This project develops an AI system that can:
- Classify 7 different types of skin lesions
- Handle extreme class imbalance effectively
- Provide explainable predictions through Grad-CAM visualizations
- Achieve clinically relevant performance across all classes

## üìä Dataset Information

### HAM10000 Dataset
The HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset contains dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.

**Dataset Statistics:**
```
Total Images: 10,015
Classes: 7
Image Size: 600x450 pixels (resized to 224x224)
Color: RGB
```

**Class Distribution (Highly Imbalanced):**
| Class | Full Name | Samples | Percentage | Imbalance Ratio |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|----------------|
| nv | Melanocytic Nevi | 6,705 | 67% | 1:1 (majority) |
| mel | Melanoma | 1,113 | 11% | 6:1 |
| bkl | Benign Keratosis | 1,099 | 11% | 6:1 |
| bcc | Basal Cell Carcinoma | 514 | 5% | 13:1 |
| akiec | Actinic Keratoses | 327 | 3% | 20:1 |
| vasc | Vascular Lesions | 142 | 1.4% | 47:1 |
| df | Dermatofibroma | 115 | 1.1% | 58:1 |

### Medical Significance
- **Melanoma**: Most dangerous form of skin cancer
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: Most common skin cancer
- **Actinic Keratoses**: Precancerous lesions
- **Others**: Benign but require accurate differentiation

## üõ† Implementation

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Input Size**: 224x224x3
- **Output**: 7 classes (categorical)
- **Transfer Learning**: Feature extraction + fine-tuning

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Aggressive Class Weights ‚úÖ
```python
# Step 1: Compute balanced weights
y_train_classes = train_generator.classes
class_weights = compute_class_weight(
    class_weight='balanced',
    classes=np.unique(y_train_classes),
    y=y_train_classes
)
class_weights = dict(enumerate(class_weights))

# Step 2: Make weights MORE aggressive for extreme imbalance
aggressive_weights = {cls: weight**1.5 for cls, weight in class_weights.items()}

# Result: Exponentially higher penalties for minority classes
# Example weights:
# Melanocytic Nevi: 0.07    (majority - reduced penalty)
# Dermatofibroma: 72.7      (minority - 4.2x amplified penalty!)
```

#### 2. Focal Loss Implementation ‚úÖ
Addresses the "easy negative" problem in extreme imbalance:
```python
def focal_loss(gamma=2., alpha=0.25):
    """
    Focal Loss for addressing class imbalance
    - Reduces loss for well-classified examples
    - Focuses training on hard examples
    - Essential for minority class learning
    """
```

#### 3. Advanced Data Balancing ‚úÖ
- **Training Data**: Oversampled using SMOTE/RandomOverSampler
- **Validation Data**: Kept in original distribution for realistic evaluation
- **Stratified Splitting**: Maintains class proportions in train/val split

#### 4. Data Augmentation
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=20,
    zoom_range=0.15,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    vertical_flip=True,        # Important for skin lesions
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    brightness_range=[0.8, 1.2]
)
```

### Grad-CAM Explainability
- **Purpose**: Visualize which regions the model focuses on for predictions
- **Clinical Relevance**: Helps validate if model looks at medically relevant features
- **Trust Building**: Increases confidence in AI-assisted diagnosis

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Why Standard Approaches Fail
```python
# Standard training on HAM10000 typically results in:
# - Model predicts majority class for everything
# - 97% recall for Melanocytic Nevi, 0% for minorities
# - Validation accuracy worse than random (5% vs 14%)
```

### Our Solution Strategy
1. **Data Level**: Oversample minorities, stratified splitting
2. **Algorithm Level**: Focal loss, aggressive class weights  
3. **Architecture Level**: EfficientNet for feature extraction
4. **Evaluation Level**: Proper train/val separation, realistic metrics
5. **Interpretability Level**: Grad-CAM for explainable predictions

### Key Hyperparameters
```python
# Focal Loss
gamma = 2.0          # Focus on hard examples
alpha = 0.25         # Balance positive/negative

# Training
batch_size = 32
learning_rate = 1e-4
epochs = 20
patience = 5         # Early stopping

# Data Augmentation
rotation_range = 20
zoom_range = 0.15
brightness_range = [0.8, 1.2]
```
